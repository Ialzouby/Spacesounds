## 🚀 Overview

Space is silent, but the data it provides is rich with information. Sonic Sounds bridges the gap between the silent cosmos and human perception by converting electromagnetic wave data from celestial bodies into musical compositions. This project offers a unique way to experience space, especially beneficial for auditory learners and the visually impaired.

## 🎯 Features

- **Wave Data Sonification**: Converts wave data (in CSV format) into musical notes using the TwoTone tool, allowing customization of instruments, octaves, and sound styles.
- **Integrated Sound Files**: Merges individual sound files into cohesive musical pieces using VSDC on Windows.
- **Interactive Platform**: A user-friendly website showcases the project's outcomes and methodologies, enabling users to explore data and resulting soundscapes.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Utilizes a NASA radio telescope to access and process live data directly at the facility.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Wave data is captured from a NASA radio telescope (frequency & intensity).
2. **Data Conversion**: Data is saved in `.csv` format.
3. **Sonification**: [TwoTone](https://www.twotone.io/) is used to convert CSV data into musical notes.
4. **Audio Merging**: Resulting `.mp3` files are merged using VSDC to create full-length soundscapes.
5. **Web Deployment**: The final compositions are presented via an interactive website.
